PATIENT: My prescription ran out what should I do?
AI: If your prescription has run out, here are the steps you should take:

1. **Check Your Medication**: Make sure there are no refills left on your prescription. Look at the bottle or ask your pharmacy.

2. **Contact Your Doctor**: Call your healthcare provider’s office or use a patient portal if available. Explain that your prescription has run out and that you need a refill.

3. **Schedule an Appointment**: If necessary, your doctor may want to see you for a follow-up before prescribing more medication.

4. **Pharmacy Communication**: Once you have a new prescription, you can have your doctor send it directly to your pharmacy or pick it up yourself and take it there.

5. **Ask About Options**: If you are unable to reach your doctor, ask your pharmacist if they can provide a temporary refill or suggest alternatives.

Make sure to follow up with your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about your medication.
